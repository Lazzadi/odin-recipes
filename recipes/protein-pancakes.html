    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 banana</li> 
        <li>75g oats</li> 
        <li>3 large eggs</li> 
        <li>2 tbsp milk (dairy, soya, oat or nut milks all work)</li> 
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li> 
        <li>pinch of cinnamon</li> 
        <li>2 tbsp protein powder (whey, pea or whatever your preference)</li> 
        <li>coconut oil, or a flavourless oil, for frying</li> 
        <li>nut butter, maple syrup and berries or sliced banana to serve</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whizz the banana, oats, eggs, milk, baking powder, cinnamon and protein powder in a blender for 1-2 mins until smooth. Check the oats have broken down, if not, blend for another minute.</li>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan. Pour or ladle in 2-3 rounds of batter, leaving a little space between each to spread. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface and the underside is golden. Flip over and cook for another minute until cooked through. Transfer to a warmed oven and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve in stacks with nut butter, maple syrup and fruit.</li>
